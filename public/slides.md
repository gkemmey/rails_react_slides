- rails out-of-the-box asset manager
- processes and bundles javascript into an `application.js` and css into an `application.cs`
- globally exposes all the things
- auto-magically knows to look for assets in `app/assets`, `vendor/assets`, or assets bundled with gems üíé
- at one time, was cutting edge

# cool, let's just use react like we use everything else
.footnote[enter the `react_rails` gem]

- first party, published by react
- globally exposes `React`
- adds some magic to sprockets for processing `.jsx` files
- globally exposes components in `app/assets/javasacripts/components`

name: react_rails_details_02
class: middle

we could do this:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component
  // ...
  render() {
    return (
      <p> stuffs </p>
    )
  }
}
```

---

name: react_rails_details_02

but not this:

```javascript
import { DopeLibrary } from 'some_awesome_npm_thing'

class MyComponent extends React.Component
  // ...
}

export default MyComponent;
```

# we were pretending to write javascript

name: react_rails_details_04
class: middle

however, `react_ujs` was awesome üëç

```html+ruby
<div>
  <p>normal server rendered html stuffs</p>
</div>

<%= react_component 'MyComponent', props, html_options %>
```

we could punt to react if and only if it made sense, and do normal rails things for everything else

name: we_should_use_redux
class: middle

some of our pain points seemed well-suited to `redux` and this library called `redux-form`, but how do we go about using it?

- we were using sprockets
- no access to npm
- no `import { Library } from '...'`

---

name: maybe_webpack
class: middle

well, maybe we could use `webpack`

- with or without sprockets
- better than browserify? the `broswerfiy-rails` gem that marries it with sprockets
- via the `react_on_rails` gem?
- so many questions...?

# sprockets + webpack

name: why_keep_sprockets
class: middle

why keep sprockets? ü§î

- let's us keep using gems that bundle things we want (i.e. `bootstrap`)
- we don't need to replicate the things sprockets already does, like asset hashing
- rails ‚ù§Ô∏è sprockets: it auto-magically works

name: summary
class: middle

- use rails as we always have
    - mostly server-rendered html, punt to react when it makes sense
    - gem-ified assets still easily included
    - sass assets still managed with sprockets
- use react as a first level citizen
    - access to npm libraries
    - properly imported modules
